## Benchmark Deflate on a corpus under the same measurement protocol the C
## reference benchmark uses, and emit the same TSV so benchmark/compare.sh can
## put the two side by side.
##
## Matching the protocol is the whole point. Comparing a single wall-clock run
## against a best-of-N one says nothing about the implementations, so every
## detail here mirrors benchmark/c/cbench.c:
##
##   - one untimed warmup, so the first timed pass is not paying startup costs
##   - iterate until there are both `min_iters` samples and `min_ns` of elapsed
##     time, capped by `max_ns` so the slowest levels stay tolerable
##   - report the fastest iteration, which is the one least disturbed by
##     scheduling and reproduces across machines under load
##   - throughput is uncompressed bytes per second in both directions
##   - the round trip is checked before anything is reported, so a fast wrong
##     answer cannot be mistaken for a fast right one
##
## One difference is real and not a protocol choice: cbench reuses a single
## compressor object across iterations, because that is how libdeflate is meant
## to be called. `Deflate.compress` has no such object, so it does whatever
## setup it needs on every call. That is a property of this API rather than of
## the measurement, and it is left visible instead of tuned away.
